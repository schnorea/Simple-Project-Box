# SimpleBox
OpenSCAD project to create 3d printed end caps for small project boxes that have sides made out of cardboard or other flat stock. The idea was to have the ability to create a low cost box quickly that reused materials that are readily available.

Currently you select the width and length of the caps. Future versions will allow the definition of the external or internal dimensions of the whole box and will create SVG to guide the cutting of the flat stock.
